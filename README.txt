CMPXLBRY.v0.1/

   This is a single module toy complex number implementation in COBOL.
   A naming convention for global variables is used to simulate functions using COBOL paragraphs.

CMPXLBRY.v0.2/

   This is a multiple module toy complex number implementation in COBOL using external programs to implement
    the low level complex number operations.

GA20.v0.1/

   This is an implementation of a 2D Euclidean geometric algebra, implemented with a triplet {grade, complex, complex}.  The first
   complex number represents the scalar and pseudoscalar grades, and the second represents the vector grade.

c++-complex-multiply/

   Two programs that are the logical equivalent of programs-as-library/src/MULT.cob for comparision purposes.
